# Holistic IDE Companion

The Holistic IDE Companion (hic) allows you to use VSCode tasks and debug launchers
directly from the comfort of your terminal (CLI). This allows you to use the same
tasks and debug launch targets that you or your team uses within a VSCode environment,
even if you use a very different IDE yourself.

> WARNING: This tool is far from complete and grows mostly in function of the author's needs.
> In case you do want to use the tool yourself, any contributions are welcome to make it
> more useful for your own personal use as well, in the form of feedback, requests
> and development time.

The author uses the [Helix IDE](https://helix-editor.com/) for projects that already
have task and debug launcher targets configured fully for the VSCode environment.
